\section{Intro}

This document describes the FK quadrature decoder device, developed at CTU FEE to read an array of up to 35 incremental encoders. The device consists of a DE0-Nano fpga kit, a pcb shield mounted onto the fpga and cables connecting the pcb shield to individual encoders. Both the pcb design and the vhdl code used to program the fpga kit are available from a github repository\footnote{https://github.com/ptrbroz/AA4CC\_FK\_model\_sensors}. 

The document will be split into two parts -- first being a User manual, which will describe how to set up and communicate with the device. It will be followed by a Technical manual, which is meant to aid in extending or modifying the device. It will describe the hardware and cabling, and also roughly sketch out the workings of the fpga program. 

The device uses exclusively positive numbers; when this document uses the word \emph{integer}, interpret it as \emph{unsigned integer} unless explicitly stated otherwise.

\section{User manual}

\subsection{Setting up}

To set up the device, follow theese steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If your DE0-Nano is not yet programmed, compile the quartus project and flash it into DE0-Nano. You need to program the serial configuration device, otherwise the program won't persist through a power cycle -- see DE0-Nano user manual for instructions\footnote{https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu737/tidu737.pdf, page 146}.
\item Mount the PCB shield onto the fpga kit. To determine orientation, make sure that the usb connector on the pcb and the usb connector on the fpga kit both point in the same direction. You can also make use of the pcb silkscreen (locations of pins A8 and T9 of the fpga kit are printed on it).
\item Make sure that no usb cable is connected to the fpga kit itself.
\item Connect the incremental encoders to the connectors located at the edges of the pcb shield.
\item Connect a 5V DC power source via the barrel jack.
\item Connect the pcb shield to your computer via the mini-usb port located next to the barrel jack.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Communication}

\par The device communicates with the user via bidirectional UART with following parameters: Baudrate 230400, 8 data bits, no parity. Apart from going to the usb-serial converter IC, the fpga's transmit line is also routed to pin B16 (located on the bottom gpio header)\footnote{I reccomend this site for locating pins on DE0-Nano: https://sites.google.com/site/fpgaandco/de0-nano-pinout} where a oscilloscope probe can be attached for inspection.

Upon powerup, the device will not be sending any data -- it needs to be configured first.

\subsubsection{User to device communication}

There are three types of commands the user can send to the device. Two of them consist of only a single byte that the user needs to send:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{COMMS ON} -- sending the byte 0x04 causes the device to start transmitting data, using it's current settings.
\item \textbf{COMMS OFF} -- sending the byte 0x02 causes the device to stop transmitting data.
\item \textbf{CONFIGURE} -- see below.
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{CONFIGURE} command consists of 7 bytes. It is used to choose which encoders will be reported by the device, at what resolution, how often, and lastly it allows the positions of the encoders to be reset. Upon receiving the configure command, the device will send a reply (see next section), reconfigure itself and start transmitting data.

The first byte of the command must be 0x01. The remaining 6 bytes are best thought of as an array of bits. The first 35 bits form the encoder enable vector -- when a bit in the enable vector is set to one, the corresponding encoder's position will be reported\footnote{The encoder connectors on the pcb are enumerated clockwise, starting next to the barrel jack. Their numbers are also printed on the silkscreen as JX, where X is the number.}. Bits 36 to 39 form an unsigned integer, used to represent the desired resolution in bits. Bit 40 is the position reset bit -- when it is set to one, all positions will be reset to their default value of $2^{r-1}$, where $r$ denotes the resolution in bits. The last 8 bits form another unsigned integer, this time representing the minimum time the device should wait between sending its messages, in milliseconds.


\textbf{Example: Configure command}

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/bits}
	\caption{Configure command illustration}
	\label{fig:config}
\end{figure}

The figure on this page illustrates how the configure command is assembled. The values show therein are choosen to configure the device to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Enable reading encoders 1 through 10 and 26 through 35
\item Disable reading encoders 11 through 25
\item Read them using a resolution of 12 bits
\item Reset the position counters.
\item Transmit data once every 10 milliseconds.
\end{itemize}

To achieve theese settings, the user needs to send following bytes (in this order) to the device: 0x01, 0xFF, 0xC0, 0x00, 0x7F, 0xF9, 0x0A.

\subsubsection{Settings constraints}

Following settings are valid:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Encoder enable vector} -- Any combination of ones and zeros.
\item \textbf{Resolution} -- Any integer from 1 to 13. If a zero is sent, it will be interpreted as one. 13 is the maximum resolution used within the device -- while resolution options of 14 and 15 bits are also supported, they only pad the sent data with zeros and you shouldn't use them unless you know exactly why you're doing it. (See TODO)
\item \textbf{Reset bit} -- Either 1 or 0.
\item \textbf{Minimum time between messages} -- Any integer between 0 and 255. Be aware that this is the minimum time -- the actual time between messages will always be at least as long as it takes to transmit all the data. Formula for minimum time it takes to transmit: $(ceil(\frac{(r+1)\cdot{}E}{8}) + 3)\cdot{}\frac{10}{B}$, where r is resolution in bits, E is the number of enabled encoders and B is Baud = 230400.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Device to user communication}

The device can send two types of messages to the user. Both begin with a header consisting of 3 bytes and are then followed by a number of data bytes. Reserved separator bits are inserted into the data to ensure that the byte pattern of a header does not occur within the data -- allowing for clear identification of the beginning of a message in incoming bytes.\footnote{This rule is broken if you set the resolution to 14 or 15 bits.} \\

\noindent\emph{\textbf{Configure reply message}}

This message is sent only as a reply to the configure command sent by the user. It's header always consists of bytes 0xff, 0xff, 0xf0 in this order. Following them are 7 data bytes -- those carry within them the same array of 48 bits that the user provided in their configure command, with the exception that the first bit of each data byte is instead reserved as a separator bit and is always zero.

\newpage{}
\textbf{Example: Config reply message}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/reply1}
	\caption{Configure reply illustration (Only first 5 bytes are shown)}
	\label{fig:JpgEpsCompare}
\end{figure}

The figure above illustrates how a reply to the configuration reply message to the message show in figure \ref{fig:config} would begin. \\\\

\noindent{}\emph{\textbf{Data message}}

This is the most important message -- it is used by the device to report the positions of encoders to the user.

The header of this message is a little more complex, as it carries data. Its first byte is always 0xff, its second byte is one of \{0xfc, 0xfd, 0xfe, 0xff\}, and its last byte can have many different values. When viewed as an array of 24 bits, it can be parsed thus:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bits 1 to 14 -- Reserved, will always be ones.
\item Bits 15 to 20 -- Integer representing how many encoders are enabled
\item Bits 20 to 24 -- Integer representing the resolution in bits
\end{itemize}

The header is followed by a number of data bytes, which carry the positions of each enabled encoder. Each position is sent as an integer preceded by a separator bit (which will always be zero). Thus the number of bytes you should expect can be calculated after parsing the header as $ceil(\frac{(r+1)\cdot{}E}{8})$, where r is resolution in bits and E is the number of enabled encoders. The positions are sent starting in ascending order of encoder indices.

The number of encoders and resolution should fall within certain constraints. In particular, the number of enabled encoders needs to be at most 35, and the resolution needs to be between 1 and 15 bits, otherwise the 3 bytes do not form a valid data message header. Note that the header for Config reply message appears as 63 encoders running at resolution of zero bits, and thus can be differentiated from data message headers.


\textbf{Example: Data message}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figs/reply2}
	\caption{Data message illustration}

\end{figure}

Figure above shows what a data message might look like. Upon parsing the header, the user computer performs the calculation $\frac{(6+1)\cdot{}3}{8} \approx 2.6$. Rounding (always) up, we arrive at 3 -- the number of data bytes we need to receive. The last 3 bits of the third data byte do not carry any information.

Reading the positions, we see that the third encoder is in the default position, encoder number one has moved somewhat in one direction from the default and number two has moved significantly in the opposite direction.

Note that there is no indication of the actual index of the encoders -- the user needs to keep in mind which encoders they have enabled. The message above might represent the positions of encoders 1, 2 and 3. But it may also represent the positions of encoders 5, 26 and 31, if those happen to be the ones that are enabled.
\subsection{Communications demo}

\noindent{}A terminal demo script written in python is located within this repository:\\ FK\_quadrature\_decoder\textbackslash{}python\textbackslash{}CommDemo.py.

The script consists of utilities for conversion between bytes and lists of bits, as well as a function that initialises the device with desired settings and another that parses its reply. The parsing of data messages is done in a loop in the program itself.

When using the script, you may experience bytes being discarded if you set the minimum time between messages too low. In my testing, this problem appeared to be closely related to the ammount of information printed into the terminal, as well as to whether my pc was performing other intensive operations, and would lessen or disappear altogether when I redirected the script's output into a log instead of printing it to terminal. This leads me to believe that it is a fault of the computer rather than of the device; I'm guessing it's caused by a buffer overflowing somewhere. 

The script also does not (at the time of writing) check for validity of incoming data message headers.

The script was tested on windows 10 machines, using Windows Terminal\footnote{https://github.com/microsoft/terminal} (default windows cmd does not support the return codes needed to redraw multiple lines of data).

\subsection{Reconfiguring on the fly}

As a last note: the device keeps count of the positions of all  encoders at all times; not just the ones that are currently enabled for reporting. You can, therefore, begin your experiment with only some of the encoders enabled and switch to a different set of enabled encoders later -- no position reset is necessary.
